=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Plugin::Resque - Mojolicious helper for sending jobs to a Resque queue.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Provides a helper to ease the use of Resque in your Mojolicious application.
 
    # Lite app with options
    plugin 'resque' => {
        server => 'localhost:6379',
        helper => 'resque'
    };
 
    # Same as
    plugin 'resque';
 
 
    # Full app at startup()
    sub startup {
      my $self = shift;
 
      $self->plugin( resque => {
        server => 'localhost:6379',
        helper => 'resque'
      });
    }
 
=head1 CONFIGURATION OPTIONS
 
You can pass any argument accepted by L<Resque> constructor plus:
 
=head2 helper
 
Name for the helper method created by this plugin. By default it will be 'resque'.
 
=head1 HELPERS
 
=head2 resque
 
When used without arguments this helper will return an instance of resque ready to use.
If you pass arguments those will be passed to L<Resque/push> as this is the most common method
to be used from your app in runtime.
 
So, this two examples do just the same:
 
    sub my_action {
      my $self = shift;
 
      # ping Redis server
      $self->resque->push( my_queue => {
        class => 'My::Task',
        args  => [ 'Bite my shiny metal ass!' ]
      });
 
      $self->resque( my_queue => {
        class => 'My::Task',
        args  => [ 'Bite my shiny metal ass!' ]
      });
    }
